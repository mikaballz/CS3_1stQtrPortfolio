# End-of-Quarter Reflection 
## Mikaela Isabella L. Mapalo, 9 - Cesium, 2029, CS-19

# Item No. 1
*"List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences."*

1. **Conditional Operators**
Before learning this, I had prior experience with C++ that made the learning experience much easier. However, I had some errors with completing my code sometimes because of minor typo's and issues with the placement. I was able to fix this later on because one of my classmates (who had more experience with coding than me) immediately corrected my block of code, and provided me with help. 

2. **If-Else Statement (under conditional operators)**
If-else statements were relatively easier to consume because the logic was straightforward and easier to understand. However sometimes, I would mess up my entire code block because my organization was flawed. Thankfully, we were provided with a lot of exercises that further helped me fix the organization and general development of my If-Else Statements.

3. **Loops and Iterations**
I had a bit of difficulty when it came to Loops and Iterations because I didn't have a strong foundation and logic on what it was in the first place. Thankfully, we were provided with graded exercises that would require you to code. By coding more, I was able to renew my foundation, making it easier to apply to different scenarios. 

4. **Case-Break**
At first, I thought I would never use Case-Break because of how simple the concept was. However now, I think this is one of the only code I've retained and used, in comparison to the other topics we've learned. Not because it was the "easiest" to type out and do, but because it's very straightforward and literal. 

5. **Functions**
When I first heard of functions, I immediately thought of math. I started fearing for my life right after. In a serious perspective, at first I thought functions would be relatively hard. However, the more we talked about functions the more I realized how similar it was to C++. In short, Functions are scary when you think of it in math, but when it comes to coding, it's much easier to comprehend. 

# Item No. 2
*"List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why. The why should be per topic listed."*

1. **VSCode**
Unironically, this is the only coding software I use (other than online compilers). Yet even after an entire quarter, I still struggle with VSCode -- not because Ma'am didn't teach us well on it, but because of how much you can do in VSCode. It holds various forms of coding styles and there are a lot of random things you can do. Hopefully, I'll be able to delve into the entirety of VSCode, or at least learn more about the software. 

2. **GitHub**
Similarly to VSCode, there are a bunch of things to do in GitHub. Not only that, but a lot of different people upload different types of codes in GitHub that you can explore for an infinite amount of time. However, I don't think I'm very familiar with all the functions and the other random things you could learn within GitHub. 

3. **Ternary Operators**
Sometimes, I misunderstand and exchange the concepts of some ternary operators with each other. I make a lot of mistakes when it comes to this, because I generally struggle with remembering and differentiating the different ternary operators. 

4. **General Flow**
I believe this is considered as a topic in itself, because all topics within coding or computer science has a technical or logical flow. For me, it's very easy to memorize a certain code block, but I can't use or apply it to different circumstances because I don't understand the general flow or the common logic to apply it elsewhere. 

5. **Debugging**
It's relatively easy to memorize general code blocks and work through it from there, but I find debugging genuinely very difficult. Sometimes, I would understand the topic, but I struggle to find what is wrong with the code. And even if I do find out the error and what's wrong with it, I can't really fix it either because I don't understand it as a whole, or my mind completely blanks out on ideas. 

# Item No. 3
*"Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second item."*

I think that coding is probably the best approach in improving and understanding the topics I listed on the second item. It sounds very simple and ironic, but I can't really fix something if I don't delve into it even more. It's the same thing as subjects like Math or English. If I want to improve my arithmetic and solving, I would do more exercises in relation to that, or if I wanted to improve my English grammar or comprehension, I would read more books to improve it. 

# Item No. 4
*"In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?"*

EFFECTIVE:
1. Graded Exercises (except for switch case)
I found the graded exercises very effective because it helped me clear up a lot of my previous misunderstanding with coding. It also forced me to think critically.

2. Kahoot
It makes me think very quickly, but I find it generally very fun! It brings me pressure sometimes, but it's super engaging and questions a lot more on concepts and general coding.

NOT EFFECTIVE:
1. Speed Test
It forces me to think critically in a very fast pace. However, it is often pressuring and competitive (understandably), leading to multiple mistakes and mind block sometimes.
--> However, it is sometimes effective. There is probably another way to still keep the speed test, but making it fun in the process as well. 

2. Switch Case Graded Exercise 
If I'm being very honest, this is actually pretty effective, but it is not as effective as the other graded exercise. It's generally just very simple switch case that you can easily search on the web because it isn't specific.
--> However, I did enjoy this specific switch case exercise because it was super fun regardless of its simplicity.
